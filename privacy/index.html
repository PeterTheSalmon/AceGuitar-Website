                <p>AceGuitar ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
                    explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our app.</p>

                <p>We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time without prior individual notice. The
                    date on which this Privacy Policy was last updated is shown above. If material changes are made, we
                    may notify account holders via email or provide an in-app notification. By continuing to use
                    AceGuitar after amendments are posted, you accept the revised policy.</p>

                <h2>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h2>
                <p>We only collect the data that is necessary to improve your experience with AceGuitar.</p>

                <h3>Account Data</h3>
                <p>Creating an account is optional. If you choose to create an account, we collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email address</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, we may collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full name</li>
                    <li>Date and time of account creation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you choose to upload your Projects created in AceGuitar, your data will be stored in a secure
                    Firebase Firestore database tied to your account. Projects can also be created and stored locally on
                    your device without an account. These local Projects are not accessible to us and remain entirely
                    under your control.</p>
                <p>We collect this data to allow you to login, recover your account, and access your Projects across
                    devices.</p>

                <h3>Feedback Data</h3>
                <p>If you choose to send feedback from within AceGuitar, the feedback will not be linked to your
                    personal identity. However, personal data may be shared if you choose to include a screenshot or
                    your email with your feedback. You may opt out of including these items to ensure no data is shared.
                </p>

                <h3>Usage Data</h3>
                <p>We collect anonymized usage data via Google Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to understand how the
                    app is used, improve performance, and reduce crashes. This data does not identify you personally.
                </p>
                <p>We do not sell or share personal information with third parties. However:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Firebase services (Authentication, Analytics, Crashlytics) may process your data as part of
                        their functionality</li>
                    <li>Google Analytics gathers anonymous metrics about user behavior within the app</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please refer to Firebase Privacy Policy for more details on their data handling practices.</p>
                <p>The Apple App Store and Google Play Store may collect anonymized download and usage data. Their
                    specific data collection practices are governed by their own privacy policies, which you can consult
                    separately for more information.</p>

                <h2>Users Under 13</h2>
                <p>AceGuitar is intended solely for users aged 13 years and older. We do not knowingly collect personal
                    information from anyone under the age of 13. If we become aware that personal information has been
                    collected from someone under this age without verifiable parental consent, we will delete it
                    promptly.</p>
                <p>If you believe a user under the age of 13 has created an account in violation of this policy, please
                    contact us using the details below so we can investigate and take appropriate action.</p>
                <p>By using AceGuitar or creating an account within our app, you confirm that you are at least 13 years
                    old.</p>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your data, leveraging Firebase's security measures.
                    However, no method of data transmission over the internet can guarantee complete security.</p>
                <p>If you are located outside the United States, please note that your personal information—including
                    project data—is transferred to, processed, and stored on servers located in the United States. By
                    using AceGuitar, you acknowledge these transfers and consent to processing under U.S. law, which may
                    differ from the laws in your country of residence.</p>
                <p>If any security breach occurs, we will notify affected users promptly as required by applicable laws.
                </p>
                <p>We may also disclose your information to government or law enforcement agencies if required by law or
                    legal process.</p>

                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                <p>Your personal information and Projects are retained only as long as necessary to provide you with
                    AceGuitar services. If you delete your account:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal information (email, name) will be permanently deleted</li>
                    <li>Projects stored in Firebase will be removed</li>
                    <li>Anonymous analytics data cannot be deleted as it contains no identifying information and is used
                        solely for improving app performance</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
                <p>AceGuitar may contain links to external websites or services. This Privacy Policy applies only to
                    AceGuitar. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of external sites.</p>

                <h2>Your Rights</h2>
                <p>You have the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access your personal data at any time by contacting us</li>
                    <li>Request deletion of your account and associated data, either through in-app account deletion
                        functionality or by contacting us</li>
                    <li>Object to future amendments to this policy by ceasing your use of the app</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Account Termination</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend accounts that violate our terms of service (<a
                        href="/terms" style="color: #3F8B68; text-decoration: none;">aceguitar.app/terms</a>) or this
                    privacy policy. In such cases, we will notify you via the email address associated with your
                    account.</p>

                <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update our Privacy Policy on occasion due to operational changes or evolving legal
                    requirements. We ask that you periodically check the date and review this Privacy Policy for the
                    latest information on our privacy practices. Continued use after amendments constitutes acceptance
                    of the updated policy.</p>
                <p>The most up-to-date version will always be posted at <a href="/privacy"
