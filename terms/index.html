                <p>These Terms constitute a legal agreement between you ("User," "you") and AceGuitar ("we," "our," or
                    "us"). Please read them carefully before using the app.</p>

                <h2>Eligibility</h2>
                <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App or create an account. By using the App or creating
                    an account, you represent that you are 13 years of age or older.</p>
                <p>Use of AceGuitar is prohibited where it violates local laws or regulations in your country.</p>

                <h2>Use of the App</h2>

                    <li>Create Projects locally on your device or upload them to our cloud servers if an account is
                        created.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You may NOT:</p>

                    <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code from any part of the App.</li>
                    <li>Upload malicious content (e.g., viruses) through feedback submissions or Projects stored in our

                <h2>Accounts</h2>
                <p>Creating an account is optional but required for certain features such as syncing Projects across

                <p>When creating an account, you are responsible for maintaining confidentiality of login credentials.
                </p>

                <p>We reserve the right to suspend or permanently terminate your account at our discretion if we
                    determine that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You violate these Terms;</li>
                    <li>Your actions harm other users or compromise App security;</li>
                    <li>You engage in illegal activity through AceGuitar;</li>

                <h3>Your Content</h3>
                <p>Any Projects created within AceGuitar remain solely yours unless explicitly shared otherwise by
                    written agreement with us. By uploading Projects through your account:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You grant us a non-exclusive license solely for purposes related to providing cloud-based
                        storage services (e.g., enabling cross-device access). We do not claim ownership over your work.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Our Content</h3>

                        style="color: #3F8B68; text-decoration: none;">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains how we collect
                    and process personal information like email addresses during account creation as well as anonymized

                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>AceGuitar disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to implied
                        warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</li>

                    <li>In jurisdictions where limitations on liability are prohibited, our liability shall not exceed
                        the amount you paid (if applicable) for access to AceGuitar in the six months preceding any
                        claim.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Force Majeure</h2>
                <p>We are not liable for delays or failure to perform due to causes beyond our reasonable
                    control—including but not limited to acts of nature (earthquakes, fires, floods), labor disputes,
